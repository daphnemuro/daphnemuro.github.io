<p>White shirt now red, my bloody nose
    Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
    Creeping around like no one knows
    Think you're so criminal
    Bruises, on both my knees for you
    Don't say thank you or please
    I do what I want when I'm wanting to
    My soul? So cynical</p>

    <p>So you're a tough guy
        Like it really rough guy
        Just can't get enough guy
        Chest always so puffed guy
        I'm that bad type
        Make your mama sad type
        Make your girlfriend mad tight
        Might seduce your dad type
        I'm the bad guy, duh
        I'm the bad guy, duh</p>
<P>I'm only good at being bad, bad
    I like when you get mad
    I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
    You said she's scared of me?
    I mean, I don't see what she sees
    But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne</P>
 <p>I'm a bad guy
    I'm a bad guy
    Bad guy, bad guy
    I'm a bad</p>
